# Real-Time-Scheduling-Algorithms

### Single Core Scheduling Algorithms
- Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS), with Deadline = Time period.
- Earliest Deadline First (EDF), with Deadline = Time period.

Provided the WCET and Time-periods of the taskset, the above algorithms perform the scheduability test and the graphical representation of the schedule.

### Multi Core Scheduling Algorithms
- TBD
